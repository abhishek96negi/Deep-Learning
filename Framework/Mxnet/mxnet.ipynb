    "## What is MXNet ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Build to ease the development of deep learning algorithms, MXNet is a powerful open-source deep learning framework instrument. In the last few years, the impact of deep learning has been widespread from healthcare to transportation to manufacturing and more. Deep learning is sought by companies to solve hard problems like speech recognition, object recognition and machine translation.\n",
    "MXNet is used to define, train and deploy deep neural networks. It is lean, flexible and ultra-scalable i.e. it allows fast model-training and supports a flexible programming model and multiple languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why MXNet ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with existing deep learning frameworks is that the users need to learn another system for a different programming flavor. MXNet solves this issue.\n",
    "A successful deep learning framework is one which excels in Programmability, Portability, and Scalability.\n",
    "MXNet supports multiple languages like C++, Python, R, Julia, Perl etc. This eliminates the need for learning a new language to use the framework and simplify network definitions. MXNet models are portable in a manner that they are able to fit in very small amounts of memory. Hence one can train his/her model in the cloud and deploy iton either mobile or connected device. MXNet can also scale to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.\n",

    "In mathematical notation, we represent scalars with ordinary lower cased letters ($x$, $y$, $z$).\n",

After running `y = y + x`, we'll find that `id(y)` points to a different location.

    "In machine learning, we *train* models to get better and better as a function of experience. Usually, *getting better* means minimizing a *loss function*, i.e. a score that answers \"how *bad* is our model?\" With neural networks, we choose loss functions to be differentiable with respect to our parameters. Put simply, this means that for each of the model's parameters, we can determine how much *increasing* or *decreasing* it might affect the loss. While the calculations are straightforward, for complex models, working it out by hand can be a pain.\n",

Mathematicians write this as $\\frac{dy(x)}{dx}$. At other times, we may be interested in the gradient of ``z`` with respect to ``x``, where ``z`` is a function of ``y``, which in turn, is a function of ``x``. That is, we are interested in $\\frac{d}{dx} z(y(x))$. Recall that by the chain rule $\\frac{d}{dx} z(y(x)) = \\frac{dz(y)}{dy} \\frac{dy(x)}{dx}$. So, when ``y`` is part of a larger function ``z``, and we want ``x.grad`` to store $\\frac{dz}{dx}$, we can pass in the *head gradient* $\\frac{dz}{dy}$ as an input to ``backward()``. The default argument is ``nd.ones_like(y)``. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule) for more details."

Note that the ``SGD`` optimizer in ``gluon`` also has a few bells and whistles that you can turn on at will, including *momentum* and *clipping* (both are switched off by default). These modifications can help to converge faster and we'll discuss them later when we go over a variety of optimization algorithms in detail."

What is pretty neat about the code below is that we use functions to *return* network blocks. These are then combined to larger networks (e.g. in `vgg_stack`) and this allows us to construct VGG from components. What is particularly useful here is that we can use it to reparameterize the architecture simply by changing a few lines rather than adding and removing many lines of network definitions. "
